# Ethymologies
### Stellar literally derived from Latin "Stella" which means star, in English referring "something that exceptionally perfect", 
### While Coffee referring "a godly substance which can enhance a programmer by an exceptionally amount"

# What is this?
This is a digital object called "Za Programs" which tries to mimic a Cafe

# Wait again? Why Though
The last time was an [CLI Program](https://github.com/nmluci/StellarCoffee/blob/main/docs/StellarCoffee.png), while this one is a proper Human-friendly program in a form of something called "Website"

# What This Program Actually DO?
## Simping a coffee. (again)
Jokes aside, Its simulate an digital ordering system on a coffee shop backed by an REST API

# Functionalities
Tell me more about this program? Fine.
